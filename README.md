# Unicross3D : Unified Cross-View and Cross-Domain Diffusion for Consistent Single-Image 3D Generation
This is an official implementation of "Unified Cross-View and Cross-Domain Diffusion for Consistent Single-Image 3D Generation".

UniCross3D generates **multi-view RGB images and normal maps** from a single input image and reconstructs a **textured 3D mesh**, while explicitly enforcing:
- **Cross-view geometric consistency** (stable geometry across views)
- **Cross-domain alignment** between **color ↔ normal** (appearance consistent with geometry)
 
> The training and inference source codes will be released in the coming months.
